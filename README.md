### Installation

You can download the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/QuantumPackage/qp2)

It's **only available on GNU/Linux**. It's also possible to install it on Windows 10 using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://aka.ms/wslabout) (you can find my blog post about WSL [here](https://mveril.github.io/posts/2019/03/wsl-part-1/)) **but it's not officially supported by the Quantum Package team**.
